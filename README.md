# Programming Project 4 <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

> Programming Project 4 aims to determine if there is an interweaving of string S given string X and string Y.
> There are four required test cases, each of which test out different types of interweavings.
> Proper indexes will be returned (grouped into 3's or 1's depending on the size of the X and Y string)
>
>     Test cases:
>     1. Paragraph 4: X = 101 Y = 0, S = {100010101}
>        Paragraph 4 aims to test out repetitions within the interweaving. 
>        No noise is assumed to be present. 
>     2. Test Case 2A: X = 101 Y = 010 S1 = 101|010|101|010|101|010|101
>        Test Case 2A aims to test whether there are interweavings of X|Y|X|Y within string S. 
>        No noise is assumed to be present.
>     3. Test Case 2B: X = 101 Y = 010 S2 = {0011000|101|010|101|010|101|11}. 
>        Front and tail noise is assumed to be present.
>     4. Test Case 2C: X = 101 Y = 010 S3 = {1001100110011001}. 
>        No noise is assumed to be present.
